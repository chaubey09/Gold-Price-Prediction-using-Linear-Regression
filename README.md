# Gold Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates the use of Linear Regression to predict gold prices using historical data from Yahoo Finance.

## Overview

The notebook covers the following steps:
- Downloading gold price data using the `yfinance` library.
- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and converting dates for model training.
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- Training a Linear Regression model on the historical gold prices.
- Evaluating the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.
- Visualizing the actual vs. predicted gold prices.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- yfinance

## How to Run

1. Install the required libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn yfinance
